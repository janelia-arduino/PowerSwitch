SPIDER products are high integrated multichannel SPI driver for small
current loads, such as relays & solenoids, LEDâ€™s, small bulbs and
stepper motors. SPIDER devices are designed to be used in automotive
and industrial applications with dedicated feature sets. Modularity
within the families eliminates redesign costs as far as possible.

The SPIDER family (TLE72x) consists of 4 and 8 channel low-side and 8
channel low-side/ high-side drivers with 2 configurable channels. The
products are scalable across the number of PWM inputs, current
capability and additional functions.
